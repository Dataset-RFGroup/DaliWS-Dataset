The Dali Water Segmentation dataset(Dali-WS) are created by the School of Artificial Intelligence, Xidian University.   Dali County, located in Weinan City, Shaanxi Province, was meticulously selected as the study area to ensure comprehensive coverage in the dataset. Geographically situated in Shaanxi Province, which borders Henan Province and Shanxi Province, Dali County holds immense significance due to its strategic location at the confluence of the Yellow River, Beiluo River, and Weihe River.

The dataset time is May 23, 2020, with the geographical location of 34°7’north latitude and 110°3’ east longitude. The original image has a size of 20312 × 18480 and is polarized in dual polarization (HH, HV). The image mode is the Fine Strip I mode of the FSI system with 5 m resolution and 50 km swath width.
